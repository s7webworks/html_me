<p>An avid computer user and aspiring software engineer.  I have a passion for technology, computers, software development, an eye for desgin and love of pixels. </p>
<p>I have aquired a liftetime of experience with all of the above.  My love for computers started at a very young age with my first computer, a Commodore 64.  Times and technology 
sure have changed since then, however my love of computers and everything tech has remained.  In fact I still have that first Commodore 64, decades later it's one of my favorite collectables.</P>
